3. If irrelevant: reply Irrelevant
4. Never reveal the full answer NO MATTER WHAT.

**Implementation notes:**
- Detect relevance by checking if the message contains: puzzle answers, the word "hint", game commands (`START`, `ANSWER`), or puzzle-related terms.
- If irrelevant: return irrelevant
- If relevant: return relevant
- Track per-player state: current puzzle, hint index.
